  abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0 {\texttimes}10-21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 {$\sigma$} . The source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0-180+160 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z =0.0 9-0.04+0.03 . In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3 6-4+5M{$\odot$} and 2 9-4+4M{$\odot$} , and the final black hole mass is 6 2-4+4M{$\odot$} , with 3. 0-0.5+0.5M{$\odot$} c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations are a versatile tool for providing insight into the complicated process of structure formation in cosmology. This process is mainly governed by gravity, which is the dominant force on large scales. At present, a century after the formulation of general relativity, numerical codes for structure formation still employ Newton's law of gravitation. This approximation relies on the two assumptions that gravitational fields are weak and that they originate from non-relativistic matter. Whereas the former seems well justified on cosmological scales, the latter imposes restrictions on the nature of the `dark' components of the Universe (dark matter and dark energy), which are, however, poorly understood. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation using equations consistently derived from general relativity. We study in detail the small relativistic effects for a standard lambda cold dark matter cosmology that cannot be obtained within a purely Newtonian framework. Our particle-mesh N-body code computes all six degrees of freedom of the metric and consistently solves the geodesic equation for particles, taking into account the relativistic potentials and the frame-dragging force. This conceptually clean approach is very general and can be applied to various settings where the Newtonian approximation fails or becomes inaccurate, ranging from simulations of models with dynamical dark energy or warm/hot dark matter to core collapse supernova explosions.},

  abstract = {We present a new N-body code, gevolution, for the evolution of large scale structure in the Universe. Our code is based on a weak field expansion of General Relativity and calculates all six metric degrees of freedom in Poisson gauge. N-body particles are evolved by solving the geodesic equation which we write in terms of a canonical momentum such that it remains valid also for relativistic particles. We validate the code by considering the Schwarzschild solution and, in the Newtonian limit, by comparing with the Newtonian N-body codes Gadget-2 and RAMSES. We then proceed with a simulation of large scale structure in a Universe with massive neutrinos where we study the gravitational slip induced by the neutrino shear stress. The code can be extended to include different kinds of dark energy or modified gravity models and going beyond the usually adopted quasi-static approximation. Our code is publicly available.},

  abstract = {The 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) shows positive evidence for the presence of a low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) background. In this paper, we investigate potential cosmological interpretations of this signal, specifically cosmic inflation, scalar-induced GWs, first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, and domain walls. We find that, with the exception of stable cosmic strings of field theory origin, all these models can reproduce the observed signal. When compared to the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many cosmological models seem to provide a better fit resulting in Bayes factors in the range from 10 to 100. However, these results strongly depend on modeling assumptions about the cosmic SMBHB population and, at this stage, should not be regarded as evidence for new physics. Furthermore, we identify excluded parameter regions where the predicted GW signal from cosmological sources significantly exceeds the NANOGrav signal. These parameter constraints are independent of the origin of the NANOGrav signal and illustrate how pulsar timing data provide a new way to constrain the parameter space of these models. Finally, we search for deterministic signals produced by models of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and dark matter substructures in the Milky Way. We find no evidence for either of these signals and thus report updated constraints on these models. In the case of ULDM, these constraints outperform torsion balance and atomic clock constraints for ULDM coupled to electrons, muons, or gluons.},

  abstract = {We present observations and timing analyses of 68 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) comprising the 15 yr data set of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). NANOGrav is a pulsar timing array (PTA) experiment that is sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). This is NANOGrav's fifth public data release, including both "narrowband" and "wideband" time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements and corresponding pulsar timing models. We have added 21 MSPs and extended our timing baselines by 3 yr, now spanning nearly 16 yr for some of our sources. The data were collected using the Arecibo Observatory, the Green Bank Telescope, and the Very Large Array between frequencies of 327 MHz and 3 GHz, with most sources observed approximately monthly. A number of notable methodological and procedural changes were made compared to our previous data sets. These improve the overall quality of the TOA data set and are part of the transition to new pulsar timing and PTA analysis software packages. For the first time, our data products are accompanied by a full suite of software to reproduce data reduction, analysis, and results. Our timing models include a variety of newly detected astrometric and binary pulsar parameters, including several significant improvements to pulsar mass constraints. We find that the time series of 23 pulsars contain detectable levels of red noise, 10 of which are new measurements. In this data set, we find evidence for a stochastic GW background.},

  abstract = {We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings-Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of 1014, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200-1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for the latter Bayes factors using a method that removes interpulsar correlations from our data set, finding p = 10-3 ({$\approx$}3{$\sigma$}) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of interpulsar correlations yields p = 5 {\texttimes} 10-5 to 1.9 {\texttimes} 10-4 ({$\approx$}3.5{$\sigma$}-4{$\sigma$}). Assuming a fiducial f -2/3 characteristic strain spectrum, as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is \$\{2.4\}\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ (median + 90\% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1 yr-1. The inferred gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations for a signal from a population of supermassive black hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings-Downs correlations points to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.},

  abstract = {We present a novel baryogenesis mechanism in which the asymmetry is sourced from heavy particles which either gain their mass or are created during bubble expansion in a strong first order phase transition. These particles then decay in a CP and baryon number violating way inside the bubble. The particles are inherently out of equilibrium and sufficiently dilute after wall crossing so the third Sakharov condition is easily met. Washout is avoided provided the reheat temperature is sufficiently below the scale of the heavy particles. The mechanism relies on moderate supercooling and relativistic walls which---in contrast to electroweak baryogenesis---generically leads to a sizable gravitational wave signal, although in the simplest realizations at frequencies beyond upcoming detectors. We present a simple example model and discuss the restrictions on the parameter space for the mechanism to be successful. We find that high reheat temperatures TRH{$\greaterequivlnt$}1010 GeV are generally preferred, whereas stronger supercooling allows for temperatures as low as TRH{$\sim$}106 GeV, provided the vacuum energy density is sufficiently suppressed. We briefly comment on using resonantly enhanced CP violation to achieve even lower scales.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of domain wall solitons in \$(2+1)d\$ field theories. These objects are extended along one of the spatial directions, so they also behave as strings; hence the name of domain wall strings. We show analytically and numerically that the amount of radiation from the propagation of wiggles on these objects is negligible except for regions of high curvature. Therefore, at low curvatures, the domain wall strings behave exactly as the Nambu-Goto action predicts. We show this explicitly with the use of several different numerical experiments of the evolution of these objects in a lattice. We then explore their dynamics in the presence of internal mode excitations. We do this again by performing field theory simulations and identify an effective action that captures the relevant interactions between the different degrees of freedom living on the string. We uncover a new parametric resonance instability that transfers energy from the internal mode to the position of the domain wall. We show that this instability accelerates the radiation of the internal mode energy. We also explore the possibility of exciting the internal mode of the soliton with the collision of wiggles on the domain wall. Our numerical experiments indicate that this does not happen unless the wiggles have already a wavelength of the order of the string thickness. Finally, we comment on the possible relevance of our findings to cosmological networks of defects. We argue that our results cast some doubts on the significance of the internal modes in cosmological applications beyond a brief transient period right after their formation. This, however, should be further investigated using cosmological simulations of our model.},

  abstract = {We study collisions between nearly planar domain walls including the effects of small initial nonplanar fluctuations. These perturbations represent the small fluctuations that must exist in a quantum treatment of the problem. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that at the linear level a subset of these fluctuations experience parametric amplification as a result of their coupling to the planar symmetric background. Here we study the full three-dimensional nonlinear dynamics using lattice simulations, including both the early time regime when the fluctuations are well described by linear perturbation theory as well as the subsequent stage of fully nonlinear evolution. We find that the nonplanar fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the overall evolution of the system. Specifically, once these fluctuations begin to interact nonlinearly the split into a planar symmetric part of the field and the nonplanar fluctuations loses its utility. At this point the colliding domain walls dissolve, with the endpoint of this being the creation of a population of oscillons in the collision region. The original (nearly) planar symmetry has been completely destroyed at this point and an accurate study of the system requires the full three-dimensional simulation.},

  abstract = {Screening mechanisms allow light scalar fields to dynamically avoid the constraints that come from our lack of observation of a long-range fifth force. Galactic scale tests are of particular interest when the light scalar is introduced to explain the dark matter or dark energy that dominates our cosmology. To date, much of the literature that has studied screening in galaxies has described screening using simplifying approximations. In this work, we calculate numerical solutions for scalar fields with screening mechanisms in galactic contexts, and use these to derive new, precise conditions governing where fifth forces are screened. We show that the commonly used binary screened/unscreened threshold can predict a fifth force signal in situations where a fuller treatment does not, leading us to conclude that existing constraints might be overestimated. We show that various other approximations of the screening radius provide a more accurate proxy to screening, although they fail to exactly reproduce the true screening surface in certain regions of parameter space. As a demonstration of our scheme, we apply it to an idealised Milky Way and thus identify the region of parameter space in which the solar system is screened.},

We impose the constraints from the unitarity, stability and the global minimal of the vacuum solutions on the model parameter space. The CP domain wall profiles and tensions are obtained by numerically solving the relevant field equations. The explicit CP violation terms are then introduced to the potential as biased terms to make the domain walls unstable and collapse, The BBN bound on the magnitude of the energy bias is taken into account. To achieve sufficiently strong gravitational wave signals, the domain wall tension {$\sigma$} is required to be at least {$\sigma$}/TeV3 {$\sim$} O(103). We find that the gravitational wave spectrum can be probed in the future SKA and/or DECIGO programs, when the typical mass scale is at least {$\sim$} O(10) TeV and the explicit CP violation terms are as small as O(10-29) - O(10-27). The gravitational waves from collapsing domain walls thus provide a complementarity to the probe of extremely small CP violation at high-energy scale.},

In asevolution, the scalar field is dynamic and can form nonlinear structures. A cubic term is added in the symmetron potential to make the symmetrybroken vacuum expectation values different, which is motivated by observational tensions in the late-time universe. To study the effects of the scalar field dynamics, we also implement a constraint solver making use of the quasi-static approximation, and provide options for evaluating the background evolution, including using the full energy density averaged over the simulation box within the Friedmann equation. The asevolution code is validated by comparison with the Newtonian N -body code ISIS that makes use of the quasi-static approximation. There is found a very small effect of including relativistic and weak-field corrections in our small test simulations; it is seen that for small masses, the field is dynamic and can not be accurately solved for using the quasi-static approximation; and we observe the formation of unstable domain walls and demonstrate a useful way to identify them within the code. A first consideration indicates that the domain walls are more unstable in the asymmetron scenario.},

By extensively testing the temporal and spatial convergence of domain decompositioning and domain wall stability, we determined criteria and physical intuition for the convergence.

  abstract = {For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.},

The spectrum from such collisions takes the form of a broken power law. We consider a toy model for such a phase transition, where the dynamics of the scalar field depends on a single parameter {\textasciimacron}{$\lambda$}, which controls how thin the bubble wall is at nucleation and how close to degenerate the vacua are relative to the barrier. We extend on our previous work by performing a series of simulations with a range of {\textasciimacron}{$\lambda$}. The peak of the gravitational-wave power spectrum varies by up to a factor of 1.3, which is probably an unobservable effect. We find that the UV power law in the gravitational-wave spectrum becomes steeper as {\textasciimacron}{$\lambda\rightarrow$}0, varying between k-1.4 and k-2.2 for the {\textasciimacron}{$\lambda$} considered. This provides some evidence that the form of the underlying effective potential of a vacuum first-order phase transition could be determined from the gravitational-wave spectrum it produces.},

The reader is then introduced to perturbations about an FLRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their primordial generation by inflation, and their observational consequences: the acoustic peaks in the CMB; the E/B decomposition in polarization; gravitational lensing of the CMB and large-scale structure; and the BAO standard ruler and redshift-space distortions in galaxy clustering.

  abstract = {Preheating after inflation involves large, time-dependent field inhomogeneities, which act as a classical source of gravitational radiation. The resulting spectrum might be probed by direct detection experiments if inflation occurs at a low enough energy scale. In this paper, we develop a theory and algorithm to calculate, analytically and numerically, the spectrum of energy density in gravitational waves produced from an inhomogeneous background of stochastic scalar fields in an expanding universe. We derive some generic analytical results for the emission of gravity waves by stochastic media of random fields, which can test the validity/accuracy of numerical calculations. We contrast our method with other numerical methods in the literature, and then we apply it to preheating after chaotic inflation. In this case, we are able to check analytically our numerical results, which differ significantly from previous works. We discuss how the gravity wave spectrum builds up with time and find that the amplitude and the frequency of its peak depend in a relatively simple way on the characteristic spatial scale amplified during preheating. We then estimate the peak frequency and amplitude of the spectrum produced in two models of preheating after hybrid inflation, which for some parameters may be relevant for gravity wave interferometric experiments.},

We show that the generalised Lorenz gauge (defined as the linear analogue of the GHG-gauge) propagates. Moreover, the equation for the conformal factor can be trivialised with an appropriate choice for the gauge source functions; this permits a scri-fixing strategy using gauge source functions for the linearised wave-like CEFE-GHG, which can in principle be generalised to the nonlinear case.

DWs that annihilate at temperatures {$\sim$} 20--50 MeV with tensions {$\sim$} (40--100 TeV)3 provide as good a fit to both datasets as the astrophysical background from supermassive black hole mergers. DWs may decay into the Standard Model (SM) or a dark sector. In the latter case we predict an abundance {$\Delta$} N eff of dark radiation well within the reach of upcoming CMB surveys. Complementary signatures at colliders and laboratories can arise if couplings to the SM are present. As an example, we discuss heavy axion scenarios, where DW annihilation may interestingly be induced by QCD confinement.},

At each point, the molecules collectively orient themselves along a privileged direction, which locally defines an orientational order. Sometimes, this order is broken, and singularities appear in the form of topological defects. This tutorial article is dedicated to the geometry, topology, and physics of these defects. We introduce the main models used to describe the nematic phase and discuss the isotropic--nematic phase transition. Then, we present the different families of defects in nematics and examine some of their physical outcomes. Finally, we show that topological defects are universal patterns of nature, appearing not only in soft matter, but also in biology, cosmology, geology, and even particle physics.},

The scalars couple both through the surface torsion of the background world sheet geometry which acts as a vector potential and through an effective mass matrix which is a sum of a quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and a linear term in the spacetime curvature. The coupling simplifies enormously for many physically interesting geometries.

The presence of such new degrees of freedom is, however, tightly constrained from several observations and experiments that aim to test general relativity in a wide range of scales. The viability of a given modified theory of gravity, therefore, strongly depends on the existence of a screening mechanism that suppresses the extra degrees of freedom. We perform simulations, and find that waves propagating in the new degrees of freedom can significantly impact the efficiency of some screening mechanisms, thereby threatening the viability of these modified gravity theories. Specifically, we show that the waves produced in the symmetron model can increase the amplitude of the fifth force and the parametrized post Newtonian parameters by several orders of magnitude.},

In regions of sufficiently high matter density, the field is drawn towards {$\phi$}=0 where its coupling to matter vanishes and the {$\phi\rightarrow$}-{$\phi$} symmetry is restored. In regions of low density, however, the symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the field couples to matter with gravitational strength. We predict deviations from general relativity in the solar system that are within reach of next-generation experiments, as well as astrophysically observable violations of the equivalence principle. The model can be distinguished experimentally from Brans-Dicke gravity, chameleon theories and brane-world modifications of gravity.},

The symmetron is decoupled and screened in regions of high density, thereby satisfying local constraints from tests of gravity, but couples with gravitational strength in regions of low density, such as the cosmos. In this paper we derive the cosmological expansion history in the presence of a symmetron field, tracking the evolution through the inflationary, radiation- and matter-dominated epochs, using a combination of analytical approximations and numerical integration. For a broad range of initial conditions at the onset of inflation, the scalar field reaches its symmetry-breaking vacuum by the present epoch, as assumed in the local analysis of spherically symmetric solutions and tests of gravity. For the simplest form of the potential, the energy scale is too small for the symmetron to act as dark energy, hence we must add a cosmological constant to drive late-time cosmic acceleration. We briefly discuss a class of generalized, nonrenormalizable potentials that can have a greater impact on the late-time cosmology, though cosmic acceleration requires a delicate tuning of parameters in this case.},

We perform three-dimensional lattice simulations and compute the spectra of axions and gravitational waves produced by long-lived domain walls. Using the numerical results, we estimated relic density of axions and gravitational waves. We find that the existence of long-lived domain walls leads to the overproduction of cold dark matter axions, while the density of gravitational waves is too small to observe at the present time. Combining the results with other observational constraints, we find that the whole parameter region of models are excluded unless an unacceptable fine-tuning exists.},

Since the background is curved, gravitational radiation develops a tail part arriving after the main signal that travels along the past light cone of the observer. First we discuss first order gravitational wave sourced by a binary system, and we find that the tail only gives a negligible memory, in accord with previous results. Then we study the nonlinear memory effect coming from induced gravitational radiation sourced by first order gravitational radiation propagating over cosmological distances. In the light cone part of the induced gravitational wave we find a novel term missed in previous studies of the cosmological memory effect. Furthermore, we show that the induced gravitational wave has a tail part that slowly accumulates after the light cone part has passed and grows to a sizeable magnitude over a cosmological timescale. This tail part of the memory effect will be a new component in the stochastic gravitational wave background.},

We apply two different methods to calculate the gravitational wave spectrum: One is to calculate the gravitational wave spectrum directly from numerical simulations, and another is to calculate it indirectly by estimating the unequal time anisotropic stress power spectrum of the scalar field. Both analysises indicate that the slope of the spectrum changes at two characteristic frequencies corresponding to the Hubble radius at the decay of domain walls and the width of domain walls, and that the spectrum between these two characteristic frequencies becomes flat or slightly red tilted. The second method enables us to evaluate the GW spectrum semi-analytically for the frequencies which can not be resolved in the finite box lattice simulations, but relies on the assumptions for the unequal time correlations of the source.},

  abstract = {In the linearized-gravity approximation we numerically compute the amount of gravitational radiation produced by the collision of two true-vacuum bubbles in Minkowski space. The bubbles are separated by distance d and we calculate the amount of gravitational radiation that is produced in a time {$\tau\sim$}d (in a cosmological phase transition {$\tau$} corresponds to the duration of the transition, which is expected to be of the order of the mean bubble separation d). Our approximations are generally valid for {$\tau\lessequivlnt$}H-1. We find that the amount of gravitational radiation produced depends only upon the grossest features of the collision: the time {$\tau$} and the energy density associated with the false-vacuum state, {$\rho$}vac. In particular, the spectrum dEGW/d{$\omega\propto\rho$}2vac{$\tau$}6 and peaks at a characteristic frequency {$\omega$}max{$\simeq$}3.8/{$\tau$}, and the fraction of the vacuum energy released into gravitational waves is about 1.3{\texttimes}10-3({$\tau$}/H-1)2, where H2=8{$\pi$}G{$\rho$}vac/3 ({$\tau$}/H-1 is expected to be of the order of a few percent). We address in some detail the important symmetry issues in the problem, and how the familiar ``quadrupole approximation'' breaks down in a most unusual way: it overestimates the amount of gravitational radiation produced in this highly relativistic situation by more than a factor of 50. Most of our results are for collisions of bubbles of equal size, though we briefly consider the collision of vacuum bubbles of unequal size. Our work implies that the vacuum-bubble collisions associated with strongly first-order phase transition are a very potent cosmological source of gravitational radiation.},

In order to study these effects, we extend the effective field theory formalism of Goldberger and Rothstein to minimal scalar-tensor theories of gravity. This class of models is still very broad, because the couplings of the scalar to matter are far less constrained than those a massless spin-2 field. In most of the paper we focus on conformal couplings. Using the effective field theory approach, we discuss the emergence of violations of the strong equivalence principle even in models that exhibit universality of free fall at the microscopic level. Our results on the conservative dynamics of the binary and its power emitted in gravitational and scalar radiation agree with those obtained with the standard post-Newtonian formalism. We also compare them to more recent work. Finally, we discuss the implications of considering a disformal coupling to matter.},

However, quantum field theory is too important, too beautiful and too engaging to be restricted to the professionals. This book on quantum field theory is designed to be different. It is written by experimental physicists and aimed to provide the interested amateur with a bridge from undergraduate physics to quantum field theory.

  abstract = {The symmetry can be broken at high temperature and then restored at low temperature, which is the so-called {\textbackslash}emph\{high temperature symmetry breaking\}. It often appears in some theories such as the high scale electroweak baryogenesis mechanism. In this paper, we probe the high temperature \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry breaking with gravitational waves (GWs) from domain wall annihilation. We first introduce a scalar with \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry and few of singlet fermions that interact with scalar through a five-dimension operator. This can lead to the scalar potential has a non-zero minimum at high temperature. At the early stage, the scalar is pinned at symmetric phase due to the large Hubble fraction. When the scalar thermal mass becomes comparable to the Hubble parameter, it can quickly roll down to the minimum of potential. Then the \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry is spontaneously broken and the domain walls will form. With the decrease of temperature, \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry will be restored. We find that if domain walls are formed at \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}){\textasciitilde} {\textbackslash}rm GeV\$, the GW produced by domain wall annihilation is expected to be observed by BBO, CE and ET. In addition, we also discuss the relationships between this scenario and NANOGrav signal.},

Part I includes applications to several important examples arising in cosmology: a univese dominated by hydrodynamical matter, a universe filled with scalar-field matter, and higher-derivative theories of gravity. The growth rates of perturbations are calculated analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis is applied to study the evolution of fluctuations in inflationary universe models. Part II includes a unified description of the quantum generation and evolution of inhomogeneities about a classial Friedmann background. The method is based on standard canonical quantization of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The spectrum of density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations is calculated in universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary universe models with scalar-field matter, and in higher-derivative theories of gravity. The gauge-invariant theory of classical and quantized cosmological perturbations developed in parts I and II is applied in part III to several interesting physical problems. It allows a simple derivation of the relation between temperature anistropes in the cosmic microwave background. radiation and the gauge-invariant potential for metric perturbations. The generation and evolution of gravitational waves is studied. As another example, a simple analysis of entropy perturbations and non-scale-invariant spectra in inflationary universe models is presented. The gauge-invariant theory of cosmological perturbations also allows a consistent and gauge-invariant definition of statistical fluctuations.},

A discrete Z2 {\texttimes} Z2 symmetry is imposed in the model and the added scalars acquire a non zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) when the imposed symmetry is broken spontaneously. The real (CP even) parts of the complex scalars mix with the SM Higgs and give three physical mass eigenstates. One of these physical mass eigenstates is attributed to the SM like Higgs boson with mass 125.09 GeV. In the present scenario, domain walls are formed in the early Universe due to the breaking of discrete Z2 {\texttimes} Z2 symmetry. In order to ensure the unstability of the domain wall this discrete symmetry is also explicitly broken by adding a bias potential to the Lagrangian. The unstable annihilating domain walls produce a significant amount of gravitational waves (GWs). In addition, we also explore the possibility of the production of GW emission from the strong first-order phase transition. We calculate the intensities and frequencies of each of such gravitational waves originating from two different phenomena of the early Universe namely annihilating domain walls and strong first-order phase transition. Finally, we investigate the observational signatures from these GWs at the future GW detectors such as ALIA, BBO, DECIGO, LISA, TianQin, Taiji, aLIGO, aLIGO+ and pulsar timing arrays such as SKA, IPTA, EPTA, PPTA, NANOGrav11 and NANOGrav12.5.},

This is expected to lead to an unstable network of domain walls with slightly different value of the gravitational constant \$G\$ on each side of the wall. This network would be in constant interaction with matter overdensities and would lead to interesting observational signatures which could be detected as gravitational and expansion rate transitions in redshift space.

  abstract = {Whenever the potential of a scalar field has two or more separated, degenerate minima, then domain walls form as the universe cools. We calculate the evolution of the resulting network of domain walls, for the case of two potential minima, by direct numerical integration of the partial differential equations of the scalar field, in two and three dimensions, thus including wall annihilation, crossing, and reconnection (intercommutation) effects. Three dimensional simulations were run on a 200 x 200 x 200 mesh, while two-dimensional simulations (three-dimensional equations but slab symmetry in one coordinate) were run on a mesh of 1024 x 1024. We find that the nature of the evolution is largely independent of the rate at which the universe expands, if time is measured in conformal units so that the wave operator in comoving space does not depend on the expansion. This means that our results should apply to walls both inside and outside the particle horizon. We find that, unlike cosmic strings, wall evolution does not leave behind many fragments or other topological detritus. Wall annihilation and reconnection occurs almost as fast as causality allows, so that the horizon volume is "swept clean" and contains, at any time, only about one, fairly smooth, wall. Quantitative statistics are given. The rms velocity of walls is {\textasciitilde} 0.4c. Wall "bubbles" or "bags" are rare and collapse almost immediately, radiating away their energy as field excitations (schizons). Up to a logarithmic correction (discussed in some detail and related to the critical behavior of self-avoiding random walks in two-dimensions) the total (comoving) area of wall per (comoving) volume decreases as the first power of (conformal) time. In a matter dominated universe, this implies {$\rho$}wall is proportional to alpha{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}-3/2{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}. The relative slowness of this decrease, along with the fact that the wall is smooth on the horizon scale, makes it impossible for walls (if they move freely and if they survive to the present) both to generate large-scale structure and to be consistent with quadrupole microwave background anisotropy limits.},

  abstract = {In this contribution, we discuss the cosmological scenario where unstable domain walls are formed in the early universe and their late-time annihilation produces a significant amount of gravitational waves. After describing cosmological constraints on long-lived domain walls, we estimate the typical amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves observed today. We also review possible extensions of the standard model of particle physics that predict the formation of unstable domain walls and can be probed by observation of relic gravitational waves. It is shown that recent results of pulser timing arrays and direct detection experiments partially exclude the relevant parameter space, and that a much wider parameter space can be covered by the next generation of gravitational wave observatories.},

A large string/domain wall network will be very quickly reduced into small bounded pieces of domain wall, which can then decay. In the early universe, this mechanism implies the demise of axionic domain walls after 104-105 seconds.},

  abstract = {Kinks and domain walls are the simplest kind of solitons and are invaluable for testing various ideas and for learning about non-perturbative aspects of field theories. They are the subject of research in essentially every branch of physics, ranging from condensed matter to cosmology. This book is an introduction to kinks and domain walls and their principal classical and quantum properties. The book examines classical solitons, building from examples in elementary systems to more complicated settings. The formation of solitons in phase transitions, their dynamics and their cosmological consequences are further discussed. The book closes with an explicit description of a few laboratory systems containing solitons. Kinks and Domain Walls includes several state-of-the-art results, some previously unpublished. Each chapter closes with open questions and research problems and will be of great interest to both graduate students and academic researchers in theoretical physics, particle physics, cosmology and condensed matter physics.},

This study has been one of the major driving forces in cosmology over the last decade, and lies at the fruitful intersection of particle physics and cosmology. After an introduction to standard cosmological theory and the theory of phase transitions in the early universe, the book then describes, in turn, the properties, formation, and cosmological implications of cosmic strings, monopoles, domain walls and textures. The book concludes with a chapter considering the role of topological defects in inflationary universe models. Ample introductory material is included to make the book accessible to the wide audience of particle physicists, astrophysicists and cosmologists for whom this topic is of immediate interest},
