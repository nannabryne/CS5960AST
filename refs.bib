  abstract = {We study collisions between nearly planar domain walls including the effects of small initial nonplanar fluctuations. These perturbations represent the small fluctuations that must exist in a quantum treatment of the problem. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that at the linear level a subset of these fluctuations experience parametric amplification as a result of their coupling to the planar symmetric background. Here we study the full three-dimensional nonlinear dynamics using lattice simulations, including both the early time regime when the fluctuations are well described by linear perturbation theory as well as the subsequent stage of fully nonlinear evolution. We find that the nonplanar fluctuations have a dramatic effect on the overall evolution of the system. Specifically, once these fluctuations begin to interact nonlinearly the split into a planar symmetric part of the field and the nonplanar fluctuations loses its utility. At this point the colliding domain walls dissolve, with the endpoint of this being the creation of a population of oscillons in the collision region. The original (nearly) planar symmetry has been completely destroyed at this point and an accurate study of the system requires the full three-dimensional simulation.},

In asevolution, the scalar field is dynamic and can form nonlinear structures. A cubic term is added in the symmetron potential to make the symmetrybroken vacuum expectation values different, which is motivated by observational tensions in the late-time universe. To study the effects of the scalar field dynamics, we also implement a constraint solver making use of the quasi-static approximation, and provide options for evaluating the background evolution, including using the full energy density averaged over the simulation box within the Friedmann equation. The asevolution code is validated by comparison with the Newtonian N -body code ISIS that makes use of the quasi-static approximation. There is found a very small effect of including relativistic and weak-field corrections in our small test simulations; it is seen that for small masses, the field is dynamic and can not be accurately solved for using the quasi-static approximation; and we observe the formation of unstable domain walls and demonstrate a useful way to identify them within the code. A first consideration indicates that the domain walls are more unstable in the asymmetron scenario.},

We have recognized that there exists an error in the code used in the previous study, and the correction of the error leads to the suppression of the spectrum of gravitational waves at high frequencies. The peak of the spectrum is located at the scale corresponding to the Hubble radius at the time of the decay of domain walls, and its amplitude is consistent with the naive estimation based on the quadrupole formula. Using the numerical results, the magnitude and the peak frequency of gravitational waves at the present time are estimated.

A coupling to matter of the form \$A({\textbackslash}phi)=1+{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}2\}\{M{\textasciicircum}2\}\$ leads to an explicitly broken symmetry with effective potential \$V\_\{eff\}({\textbackslash}phi)=-{\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}2 (1-{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}rho\}\{{\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}2 M{\textasciicircum}2\}){\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}2 +{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}4 + 2 {\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}3+{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}4\$. Due to the explicit symmetry breaking induced by the cubic term we call this field the 'asymmetron'. For large matter density \${\textbackslash}rho{$>\backslash$}rho\_*{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}2M{\textasciicircum}2+{\textbackslash}frac\{9\}\{4\}{\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textbackslash}eta M{\textasciicircum}2\$ the effective potential has a single minimum at \${\textbackslash}phi=0\$ leading to restoration of General Relativity as in the usual symmetron screening mechanism. For low matter density however, there is a false vacuum and a single true vacuum due to the explicit symmetry breaking. This is expected to lead to an unstable network of domain walls with slightly different value of the gravitational constant \$G\$ on each side of the wall. This network would be in constant interaction with matter overdensities and would lead to interesting observational signatures which could be detected as gravitational and expansion rate transitions in redshift space. Such a gravitational transition has been recently proposed for the resolution of the Hubble tension.},

  abstract = {We consider a simple extension of Standard Model by adding two complex singlet scalars with a U(1) symmetry. A discrete Z2 {\texttimes} Z2 symmetry is imposed in the model and the added scalars acquire a non zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) when the imposed symmetry is broken spontaneously. The real (CP even) parts of the complex scalars mix with the SM Higgs and give three physical mass eigenstates. One of these physical mass eigenstates is attributed to the SM like Higgs boson with mass 125.09 GeV. In the present scenario, domain walls are formed in the early Universe due to the breaking of discrete Z2 {\texttimes} Z2 symmetry. In order to ensure the unstability of the domain wall this discrete symmetry is also explicitly broken by adding a bias potential to the Lagrangian. The unstable annihilating domain walls produce a significant amount of gravitational waves (GWs). In addition, we also explore the possibility of the production of GW emission from the strong first-order phase transition. We calculate the intensities and frequencies of each of such gravitational waves originating from two different phenomena of the early Universe namely annihilating domain walls and strong first-order phase transition. Finally, we investigate the observational signatures from these GWs at the future GW detectors such as ALIA, BBO, DECIGO, LISA, TianQin, Taiji, aLIGO, aLIGO+ and pulsar timing arrays such as SKA, IPTA, EPTA, PPTA, NANOGrav11 and NANOGrav12.5.},

  abstract = {Preheating after inflation involves large, time-dependent field inhomogeneities, which act as a classical source of gravitational radiation. The resulting spectrum might be probed by direct detection experiments if inflation occurs at a low enough energy scale. In this paper, we develop a theory and algorithm to calculate, analytically and numerically, the spectrum of energy density in gravitational waves produced from an inhomogeneous background of stochastic scalar fields in an expanding universe. We derive some generic analytical results for the emission of gravity waves by stochastic media of random fields, which can test the validity/accuracy of numerical calculations. We contrast our method with other numerical methods in the literature, and then we apply it to preheating after chaotic inflation. In this case, we are able to check analytically our numerical results, which differ significantly from previous works. We discuss how the gravity wave spectrum builds up with time and find that the amplitude and the frequency of its peak depend in a relatively simple way on the characteristic spatial scale amplified during preheating. We then estimate the peak frequency and amplitude of the spectrum produced in two models of preheating after hybrid inflation, which for some parameters may be relevant for gravity wave interferometric experiments.},

It is a significant rewrite of the latfield framework, moving from a slab domain decomposition to a rod decomposition, where the last two dimension of the lattice are scattered into a two dimensional process grid. Parallelism is implemented using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, and hidden in the basic objects of grid-based simulations: Lattice, Site and Field. It comes with an integrated parallel fast Fourier transform, and I/O server class permitting computation to continue during the writing of large files to disk. latfield2 has been used for production runs on tens of thousands of processor elements, and is expected to be scalable to hundreds of thousands.},

Our code is based on a weak field expansion of General Relativity and calculates all six metric degrees of freedom in Poisson gauge. N-body particles are evolved by solving the geodesic equation which we write in terms of a canonical momentum such that it remains valid also for relativistic particles. We validate the code by considering the Schwarzschild solution and, in the Newtonian limit, by comparing with the Newtonian N-body codes Gadget-2 and RAMSES. We then proceed with a simulation of large scale structure in a Universe with massive neutrinos where we study the gravitational slip induced by the neutrino shear stress. The code can be extended to include different kinds of dark energy or modified gravity models and going beyond the usually adopted quasi-static approximation. Our code is publicly available.},

In these models, multiple domain walls attached to strings are formed, and they survive for a long time. Their annihilation occurs due to the effects of explicit symmetry breaking term which might be raised by Planck-scale physics. We perform three-dimensional lattice simulations and compute the spectra of axions and gravitational waves produced by long-lived domain walls. Using the numerical results, we estimated relic density of axions and gravitational waves. We find that the existence of long-lived domain walls leads to the overproduction of cold dark matter axions, while the density of gravitational waves is too small to observe at the present time. Combining the results with other observational constraints, we find that the whole parameter region of models are excluded unless an unacceptable fine-tuning exists.},

We impose the constraints from the unitarity, stability and the global minimal of the vacuum solutions on the model parameter space. The CP domain wall profiles and tensions are obtained by numerically solving the relevant field equations. The explicit CP violation terms are then introduced to the potential as biased terms to make the domain walls unstable and collapse, The BBN bound on the magnitude of the energy bias is taken into account. To achieve sufficiently strong gravitational wave signals, the domain wall tension {$\sigma$} is required to be at least {$\sigma$}/TeV3 {$\sim$} O(103). We find that the gravitational wave spectrum can be probed in the future SKA and/or DECIGO programs, when the typical mass scale is at least {$\sim$} O(10) TeV and the explicit CP violation terms are as small as O(10-29) - O(10-27). The gravitational waves from collapsing domain walls thus provide a complementarity to the probe of extremely small CP violation at high-energy scale.},

We estimate the cosmological energy fraction in domain walls and find that this leads to an upper bound on the redshift of the symmetry breaking.

These particles then decay in a CP and baryon number violating way inside the bubble. The particles are inherently out of equilibrium and sufficiently dilute after wall crossing so the third Sakharov condition is easily met. Washout is avoided provided the reheat temperature is sufficiently below the scale of the heavy particles. The mechanism relies on moderate supercooling and relativistic walls which---in contrast to electroweak baryogenesis---generically leads to a sizable gravitational wave signal, although in the simplest realizations at frequencies beyond upcoming detectors. We present a simple example model and discuss the restrictions on the parameter space for the mechanism to be successful. We find that high reheat temperatures TRH{$\greaterequivlnt$}1010 GeV are generally preferred, whereas stronger supercooling allows for temperatures as low as TRH{$\sim$}106 GeV, provided the vacuum energy density is sufficiently suppressed. We briefly comment on using resonantly enhanced CP violation to achieve even lower scales.},

We consider a toy model for such a phase transition, where the dynamics of the scalar field depends on a single parameter {\textasciimacron}{$\lambda$}, which controls how thin the bubble wall is at nucleation and how close to degenerate the vacua are relative to the barrier. We extend on our previous work by performing a series of simulations with a range of {\textasciimacron}{$\lambda$}. The peak of the gravitational-wave power spectrum varies by up to a factor of 1.3, which is probably an unobservable effect. We find that the UV power law in the gravitational-wave spectrum becomes steeper as {\textasciimacron}{$\lambda\rightarrow$}0, varying between k-1.4 and k-2.2 for the {\textasciimacron}{$\lambda$} considered. This provides some evidence that the form of the underlying effective potential of a vacuum first-order phase transition could be determined from the gravitational-wave spectrum it produces.},

The bubbles are separated by distance d and we calculate the amount of gravitational radiation that is produced in a time {$\tau\sim$}d (in a cosmological phase transition {$\tau$} corresponds to the duration of the transition, which is expected to be of the order of the mean bubble separation d). Our approximations are generally valid for {$\tau\lessequivlnt$}H-1. We find that the amount of gravitational radiation produced depends only upon the grossest features of the collision: the time {$\tau$} and the energy density associated with the false-vacuum state, {$\rho$}vac. In particular, the spectrum dEGW/d{$\omega\propto\rho$}2vac{$\tau$}6 and peaks at a characteristic frequency {$\omega$}max{$\simeq$}3.8/{$\tau$}, and the fraction of the vacuum energy released into gravitational waves is about 1.3{\texttimes}10-3({$\tau$}/H-1)2, where H2=8{$\pi$}G{$\rho$}vac/3 ({$\tau$}/H-1 is expected to be of the order of a few percent). We address in some detail the important symmetry issues in the problem, and how the familiar ``quadrupole approximation'' breaks down in a most unusual way: it overestimates the amount of gravitational radiation produced in this highly relativistic situation by more than a factor of 50. Most of our results are for collisions of bubbles of equal size, though we briefly consider the collision of vacuum bubbles of unequal size. Our work implies that the vacuum-bubble collisions associated with strongly first-order phase transition are a very potent cosmological source of gravitational radiation.},

These objects are extended along one of the spatial directions, so they also behave as strings; hence the name of domain wall strings. We show analytically and numerically that the amount of radiation from the propagation of wiggles on these objects is negligible except for regions of high curvature. Therefore, at low curvatures, the domain wall strings behave exactly as the Nambu-Goto action predicts. We show this explicitly with the use of several different numerical experiments of the evolution of these objects in a lattice. We then explore their dynamics in the presence of internal mode excitations. We do this again by performing field theory simulations and identify an effective action that captures the relevant interactions between the different degrees of freedom living on the string. We uncover a new parametric resonance instability that transfers energy from the internal mode to the position of the domain wall. We show that this instability accelerates the radiation of the internal mode energy. We also explore the possibility of exciting the internal mode of the soliton with the collision of wiggles on the domain wall. Our numerical experiments indicate that this does not happen unless the wiggles have already a wavelength of the order of the string thickness. Finally, we comment on the possible relevance of our findings to cosmological networks of defects. We argue that our results cast some doubts on the significance of the internal modes in cosmological applications beyond a brief transient period right after their formation. This, however, should be further investigated using cosmological simulations of our model.},

  abstract = {Extending general relativity by adding extra degrees of freedom is a popular approach for explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe and to build high energy completions of the theory of gravity. The presence of such new degrees of freedom is, however, tightly constrained from several observations and experiments that aim to test general relativity in a wide range of scales. The viability of a given modified theory of gravity, therefore, strongly depends on the existence of a screening mechanism that suppresses the extra degrees of freedom. We perform simulations, and find that waves propagating in the new degrees of freedom can significantly impact the efficiency of some screening mechanisms, thereby threatening the viability of these modified gravity theories. Specifically, we show that the waves produced in the symmetron model can increase the amplitude of the fifth force and the parametrized post Newtonian parameters by several orders of magnitude.},

In order to study these effects, we extend the effective field theory formalism of Goldberger and Rothstein to minimal scalar-tensor theories of gravity. This class of models is still very broad, because the couplings of the scalar to matter are far less constrained than those a massless spin-2 field. In most of the paper we focus on conformal couplings. Using the effective field theory approach, we discuss the emergence of violations of the strong equivalence principle even in models that exhibit universality of free fall at the microscopic level. Our results on the conservative dynamics of the binary and its power emitted in gravitational and scalar radiation agree with those obtained with the standard post-Newtonian formalism. We also compare them to more recent work. Finally, we discuss the implications of considering a disformal coupling to matter.},

We apply two different methods to calculate the gravitational wave spectrum: One is to calculate the gravitational wave spectrum directly from numerical simulations, and another is to calculate it indirectly by estimating the unequal time anisotropic stress power spectrum of the scalar field. Both analysises indicate that the slope of the spectrum changes at two characteristic frequencies corresponding to the Hubble radius at the decay of domain walls and the width of domain walls, and that the spectrum between these two characteristic frequencies becomes flat or slightly red tilted. The second method enables us to evaluate the GW spectrum semi-analytically for the frequencies which can not be resolved in the finite box lattice simulations, but relies on the assumptions for the unequal time correlations of the source.},

  abstract = {Whenever the potential of a scalar field has two or more separated, degenerate minima, then domain walls form as the universe cools. We calculate the evolution of the resulting network of domain walls, for the case of two potential minima, by direct numerical integration of the partial differential equations of the scalar field, in two and three dimensions, thus including wall annihilation, crossing, and reconnection (intercommutation) effects. Three dimensional simulations were run on a 200 x 200 x 200 mesh, while two-dimensional simulations (three-dimensional equations but slab symmetry in one coordinate) were run on a mesh of 1024 x 1024. We find that the nature of the evolution is largely independent of the rate at which the universe expands, if time is measured in conformal units so that the wave operator in comoving space does not depend on the expansion. This means that our results should apply to walls both inside and outside the particle horizon. We find that, unlike cosmic strings, wall evolution does not leave behind many fragments or other topological detritus. Wall annihilation and reconnection occurs almost as fast as causality allows, so that the horizon volume is "swept clean" and contains, at any time, only about one, fairly smooth, wall. Quantitative statistics are given. The rms velocity of walls is {\textasciitilde} 0.4c. Wall "bubbles" or "bags" are rare and collapse almost immediately, radiating away their energy as field excitations (schizons). Up to a logarithmic correction (discussed in some detail and related to the critical behavior of self-avoiding random walks in two-dimensions) the total (comoving) area of wall per (comoving) volume decreases as the first power of (conformal) time. In a matter dominated universe, this implies {$\rho$}wall is proportional to alpha{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}-3/2{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}. The relative slowness of this decrease, along with the fact that the wall is smooth on the horizon scale, makes it impossible for walls (if they move freely and if they survive to the present) both to generate large-scale structure and to be consistent with quadrupole microwave background anisotropy limits.},

The growth rates of perturbations are calculated analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis is applied to study the evolution of fluctuations in inflationary universe models. Part II includes a unified description of the quantum generation and evolution of inhomogeneities about a classial Friedmann background. The method is based on standard canonical quantization of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The spectrum of density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations is calculated in universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary universe models with scalar-field matter, and in higher-derivative theories of gravity. The gauge-invariant theory of classical and quantized cosmological perturbations developed in parts I and II is applied in part III to several interesting physical problems. It allows a simple derivation of the relation between temperature anistropes in the cosmic microwave background. radiation and the gauge-invariant potential for metric perturbations. The generation and evolution of gravitational waves is studied. As another example, a simple analysis of entropy perturbations and non-scale-invariant spectra in inflationary universe models is presented.

  abstract = {For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.},

  abstract = {The 15 yr pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) shows positive evidence for the presence of a low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) background. In this paper, we investigate potential cosmological interpretations of this signal, specifically cosmic inflation, scalar-induced GWs, first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, and domain walls. We find that, with the exception of stable cosmic strings of field theory origin, all these models can reproduce the observed signal. When compared to the standard interpretation in terms of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many cosmological models seem to provide a better fit resulting in Bayes factors in the range from 10 to 100. However, these results strongly depend on modeling assumptions about the cosmic SMBHB population and, at this stage, should not be regarded as evidence for new physics. Furthermore, we identify excluded parameter regions where the predicted GW signal from cosmological sources significantly exceeds the NANOGrav signal. These parameter constraints are independent of the origin of the NANOGrav signal and illustrate how pulsar timing data provide a new way to constrain the parameter space of these models. Finally, we search for deterministic signals produced by models of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and dark matter substructures in the Milky Way. We find no evidence for either of these signals and thus report updated constraints on these models. In the case of ULDM, these constraints outperform torsion balance and atomic clock constraints for ULDM coupled to electrons, muons, or gluons.},

  abstract = {We present a screening mechanism that allows a scalar field to mediate a long-range ({$\sim$}Mpc) force of gravitational strength in the cosmos while satisfying local tests of gravity. The mechanism hinges on local symmetry restoration in the presence of matter. In regions of sufficiently high matter density, the field is drawn towards {$\phi$}=0 where its coupling to matter vanishes and the {$\phi\rightarrow$}-{$\phi$} symmetry is restored. In regions of low density, however, the symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the field couples to matter with gravitational strength. We predict deviations from general relativity in the solar system that are within reach of next-generation experiments, as well as astrophysically observable violations of the equivalence principle. The model can be distinguished experimentally from Brans-Dicke gravity, chameleon theories and brane-world modifications of gravity.},
