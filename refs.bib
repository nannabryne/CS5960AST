	abstract = {We study collisions between nearly planar domain walls including the eﬀects of small initial nonplanar ﬂuctuations. These perturbations represent the small ﬂuctuations that must exist in a quantum treatment of the problem. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that at the linear level a subset of these ﬂuctuations experience parametric ampliﬁcation as a result of their coupling to the planar symmetric background. Here we study the full three-dimensional nonlinear dynamics using lattice simulations, including both the early time regime when the ﬂuctuations are well described by linear perturbation theory as well as the subsequent stage of fully nonlinear evolution. We ﬁnd that the nonplanar ﬂuctuations have a dramatic eﬀect on the overall evolution of the system. Speciﬁcally, once these ﬂuctuations begin to interact nonlinearly the split into a planar symmetric part of the ﬁeld and the nonplanar ﬂuctuations loses its utility. At this point the colliding domain walls dissolve, with the endpoint of this being the creation of a population of oscillons in the collision region. The original (nearly) planar symmetry has been completely destroyed at this point and an accurate study of the system requires the full three-dimensional simulation.},

In asevolution, the scalar ﬁeld is dynamic and can form nonlinear structures. A cubic term is added in the symmetron potential to make the symmetrybroken vacuum expectation values diﬀerent, which is motivated by observational tensions in the late-time universe. To study the eﬀects of the scalar ﬁeld dynamics, we also implement a constraint solver making use of the quasi-static approximation, and provide options for evaluating the background evolution, including using the full energy density averaged over the simulation box within the Friedmann equation. The asevolution code is validated by comparison with the Newtonian N -body code ISIS that makes use of the quasi-static approximation. There is found a very small eﬀect of including relativistic and weak-ﬁeld corrections in our small test simulations; it is seen that for small masses, the ﬁeld is dynamic and can not be accurately solved for using the quasi-static approximation; and we observe the formation of unstable domain walls and demonstrate a useful way to identify them within the code. A ﬁrst consideration indicates that the domain walls are more unstable in the asymmetron scenario.},

We have recognized that there exists an error in the code used in the previous study, and the correction of the error leads to the suppression of the spectrum of gravitational waves at high frequencies. The peak of the spectrum is located at the scale corresponding to the Hubble radius at the time of the decay of domain walls, and its amplitude is consistent with the naive estimation based on the quadrupole formula. Using the numerical results, the magnitude and the peak frequency of gravitational waves at the present time are estimated.

A coupling to matter of the form \$A({\textbackslash}phi)=1+{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}2\}\{M{\textasciicircum}2\}\$ leads to an explicitly broken symmetry with effective potential \$V\_\{eff\}({\textbackslash}phi)=-{\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}2 (1-{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}rho\}\{{\textbackslash}mu{\textasciicircum}2 M{\textasciicircum}2\}){\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}2 +{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}4 + 2 {\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}3+{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}lambda\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}eta{\textasciicircum}4\$.

For low matter density however, there is a false vacuum and a single true vacuum due to the explicit symmetry breaking. This is expected to lead to an unstable network of domain walls with slightly different value of the gravitational constant \$G\$ on each side of the wall. This network would be in constant interaction with matter overdensities and would lead to interesting observational signatures which could be detected as gravitational and expansion rate transitions in redshift space.

	abstract = {We consider a simple extension of Standard Model by adding two complex singlet scalars with a U(1) symmetry. A discrete Z2 × Z2 symmetry is imposed in the model and the added scalars acquire a non zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) when the imposed symmetry is broken spontaneously. The real (CP even) parts of the complex scalars mix with the SM Higgs and give three physical mass eigenstates. One of these physical mass eigenstates is attributed to the SM like Higgs boson with mass 125.09 GeV. In the present scenario, domain walls are formed in the early Universe due to the breaking of discrete Z2 × Z2 symmetry. In order to ensure the unstability of the domain wall this discrete symmetry is also explicitly broken by adding a bias potential to the Lagrangian. The unstable annihilating domain walls produce a signiﬁcant amount of gravitational waves (GWs). In addition, we also explore the possibility of the production of GW emission from the strong ﬁrst-order phase transition. We calculate the intensities and frequencies of each of such gravitational waves originating from two diﬀerent phenomena of the early Universe namely annihilating domain walls and strong ﬁrst-order phase transition. Finally, we investigate the observational signatures from these GWs at the future GW detectors such as ALIA, BBO, DECIGO, LISA, TianQin, Taiji, aLIGO, aLIGO+ and pulsar timing arrays such as SKA, IPTA, EPTA, PPTA, NANOGrav11 and NANOGrav12.5.},

We derive some generic analytical results for the emission of gravity waves by stochastic media of random fields, which can test the validity/accuracy of numerical calculations. We contrast our method with other numerical methods in the literature, and then we apply it to preheating after chaotic inflation. In this case, we are able to check analytically our numerical results, which differ significantly from previous works. We discuss how the gravity wave spectrum builds up with time and find that the amplitude and the frequency of its peak depend in a relatively simple way on the characteristic spatial scale amplified during preheating. We then estimate the peak frequency and amplitude of the spectrum produced in two models of preheating after hybrid inflation, which for some parameters may be relevant for gravity wave interferometric experiments.},

It is a significant rewrite of the latfield framework, moving from a slab domain decomposition to a rod decomposition, where the last two dimension of the lattice are scattered into a two dimensional process grid. Parallelism is implemented using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard, and hidden in the basic objects of grid-based simulations: Lattice, Site and Field. It comes with an integrated parallel fast Fourier transform, and I/O server class permitting computation to continue during the writing of large files to disk. latfield2 has been used for production runs on tens of thousands of processor elements, and is expected to be scalable to hundreds of thousands.},

Our code is based on a weak ﬁeld expansion of General Relativity and calculates all six metric degrees of freedom in Poisson gauge. N-body particles are evolved by solving the geodesic equation which we write in terms of a canonical momentum such that it remains valid also for relativistic particles. We validate the code by considering the Schwarzschild solution and, in the Newtonian limit, by comparing with the Newtonian N-body codes Gadget-2 and RAMSES. We then proceed with a simulation of large scale structure in a Universe with massive neutrinos where we study the gravitational slip induced by the neutrino shear stress. The code can be extended to include diﬀerent kinds of dark energy or modiﬁed gravity models and going beyond the usually adopted quasi-static approximation. Our code is publicly available.},

In these models, multiple domain walls attached to strings are formed, and they survive for a long time. Their annihilation occurs due to the eﬀects of explicit symmetry breaking term which might be raised by Planck-scale physics. We perform three-dimensional lattice simulations and compute the spectra of axions and gravitational waves produced by long-lived domain walls. Using the numerical results, we estimated relic density of axions and gravitational waves. We ﬁnd that the existence of long-lived domain walls leads to the overproduction of cold dark matter axions, while the density of gravitational waves is too small to observe at the present time. Combining the results with other observational constraints, we ﬁnd that the whole parameter region of models are excluded unless an unacceptable ﬁne-tuning exists.},

	abstract = {We study the CP domain walls and the consequent gravitational waves induced by the spontaneous breaking of the CP symmetry in the complex singlet extension to the Standard Model. We impose the constraints from the unitarity, stability and the global minimal of the vacuum solutions on the model parameter space. The CP domain wall proﬁles and tensions are obtained by numerically solving the relevant ﬁeld equations. The explicit CP violation terms are then introduced to the potential as biased terms to make the domain walls unstable and collapse, The BBN bound on the magnitude of the energy bias is taken into account. To achieve sufﬁciently strong gravitational wave signals, the domain wall tension σ is required to be at least σ/TeV3 ∼ O(103). We ﬁnd that the gravitational wave spectrum can be probed in the future SKA and/or DECIGO programs, when the typical mass scale is at least ∼ O(10) TeV and the explicit CP violation terms are as small as O(10−29) − O(10−27). The gravitational waves from collapsing domain walls thus provide a complementarity to the probe of extremely small CP violation at high-energy scale.},

The book examines classical solitons, building from examples in elementary systems to more complicated settings. The formation of solitons in phase transitions, their dynamics and their cosmological consequences are further discussed. The book closes with an explicit description of a few laboratory systems containing solitons. Kinks and Domain Walls includes several state-of-the-art results, some previously unpublished. Each chapter closes with open questions and research problems and will be of great interest to both graduate students and academic researchers in theoretical physics, particle physics, cosmology and condensed matter physics.},
