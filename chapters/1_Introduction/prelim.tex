% ////////////////////// intro //////////////////////

We assume that the reader is familiar with basic concepts from mathematical methods in physics such as the variational principle, tensors, Green's functions and cylindrical functions. Classical field theory and linear perturbation theory will not be covered from ground level. Other than this, the thesis will be relatively self-contained, but understanding of basic modern cosmology will be an advantage. 
For reference, we cover a few of these concepts in the subsections below.

\subsection{Special relativity}
    The \newconcept{four-vector} $x\^\mu=(t, \vec{x})$ in Minkowski space $\Real[3,1]$ encompasses time $t=x\^0$ and position $\vec{x}=x\^i= (x\^1, x\^2, x\^3)$. The {metric tensor} (defined in~\cref{sec:GR:diffgeo}) in SR is $g\_{\mu\nu}= \eta\_{\mu\nu} \equiv \text{diag} (-1,+1,+1,+1)$. The four-vector $x\^\mu$ is ``naturally raised,'' whereas the derivative
    \begin{equation}
        \partial\_\mu \equiv \pdv{}{x\^\mu} =\pclosed{ \pdv{}{t}, \vec{\nabla} }
    \end{equation}
    is ``naturally lowered.'' 
    \comment{Lorentz invariance.}





\subsection{Classical field theory}
    % Consider Lorentzian \blahblah. We formulate a theory in terms of the Lorentz invariant action
    % \begin{equation}
    %     S = \int \! \dx[4]\, \mathcal{L},
    % \end{equation}
    % with $\mathcal{L}$ being the \emph{Lagrangian}\footnote{Technically, it is the Lagrangian \emph{density}, an insignificant \grammar[point]{distinction} for these purposes.} of the theory. This Lorentz invariant quantity is composed of scalar terms only.
    \comment{Fix}
    We formulate a theory of field\emph{s} $\Phi(x)$ in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in terms of the Lorentz invariant action
    \begin{equation}
        % S = \integ[4]{x} \mathcal{L}(\{\phi_i\}, \{ \partial\_{\mu} \phi_i\}),
        S = \integ[4]{x} \mathcal{L}(\Phi, \partial\_\mu \Phi),
    \end{equation}
    with $\mathcal{L}$ being the \emph{Lagrangian density} of the theory, a function of the set of fields $\Phi$ and its first derivatives. We will refer to $\mathcal{L}$ simply as the Lagrangian, as is customary when working with fields. 

    % This translates to a general (i.e.~curved) spacetime with the substitution of partial to covariant derivative and the construction of a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian,
    This translates to a general (i.e.~curved) spacetime through the construction of a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian,
    % For a general (i.e.~curved) spacetime, \blahblah $\partial\_{\mu} \to \nabla\_{\mu} $ \blahblah to construct a Lorentz invariant Lagrangian,
    \begin{equation}
        % S = \integ[4]{x}\underbrace{ \mathcal{L}(\{\phi_i\}, \{ \nabla\_{\mu} \phi_i\})}_{\text{not scalar}} =  \int \! \underbrace{\dx[4] \, \sqrt{-\abs{g}}}_{\text{scalar}} \,\underbrace{\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\{\phi_i\}, \{ \nabla\_{\mu} \phi_i\})}_{\text{scalar}}, 
        S = \integ[4]{x}\underbrace{ \mathcal{L}(\Phi,  \partial\_{\mu} \Phi)}_{\text{not scalar}} =  \int \! \underbrace{\dx[4] \, \sqrt{-g}}_{\text{scalar}} \,\underbrace{\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\Phi, \nabla\_{\mu} \Phi)}_{\text{scalar}},
    \end{equation}
    where $g= \det(g)$ is the determinant of the metric. What was applied here, was the \newconcept{minimal-coupling principle}, 
    and we may refer to $\mathcal{L}$ as the minimally-coupled Lagrangian (density). Loosely speaking, this principle involves replacing the Minkowski metric with the curved-spacetime metric ($\eta\_{\mu\nu}\to g\_{\mu\nu}$), and partial derivatives to covariant derivatives ($\partial\_{\mu} \to \nabla\_{\mu} $).
    
    % where $\hat{\mathcal{L}}$ is a scalar.

    % \comment{Action princible}


    \paragraph{Action principle.} %
    We use variational calculus to obtain the fields' equations of motion. For a scalar field $\phi$, we consider the change $\phi \to \phi + \delta \phi$ and apply this to the action, s.t. $S\to S+ \delta S$. %Identifying terms of leading order ($\mathscr{O}(\delta \phi)$), 
    After isolating $S$ and gathering terms up to leading order, we set $\delta S = 0$ and obtain an equation for $\phi$ in terms of first and second derivatives. 

    Often it is necessary to use \checkthis{Stokes' theorem} to set certain terms to zero. The argument \blahblah \comment{Fix or remove!}
    % We gather zero-order terms and isolate $S$
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Gather zero-order terms and isolate $S$.
    %     \item Identify leading-order terms to find $\delta S= \mathscr{O}(\delta \phi)$.
    %     \item Set all higher-order terms to zero, $\mathscr{O}((\delta \phi))=0$
    % \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Classical Field Theory}
    % The action
    % \begin{equation}
    %     S\ped{ST} = S\ped{EH} + S_{\phi} + S\ped{m}=  \int \!\diff[4] x \, \sqrt{-\abs{g}} \cclosed{ \frac{\Planck{M}^2}{2} R - \frac{1}{2}\nabla\indices{_{\rho}} \phi \nabla\indices{^{\rho}} \phi - V(\phi)} + S\ped{m}
    % \end{equation}

    % GR as we know it is reconstructed when varying $S\ped{E}$ with respect to the metric $g\_{\mu\nu}(x)$

\subsubsection{Perturbation theory}
    % \blahblah
    We write that to order $o$ in some small parameter $\epsilon$, we have
    \begin{equation}
        \pert{q} \equiv \sum_{i=0}^o \delta^{(i)} q =  q^{(0)} + \epsilon q^{(1)}  + \epsilon^2 q^{(2)} + \dots +  \epsilon^o q^{(o)}, 
    \end{equation}
    where 

    Consider $Q(q)$. We write
    \begin{equation}
        \pert{Q} \equiv \sum_{i=0}^o {}^{(i)} Q,
    \end{equation}
    where ${}^{(i)}Q$ is the $i$th order perturbation of $Q$, not necessarily $\epsilon^i Q$

\subsubsection{Method of Green's functions}
    A linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\mathop{\mathrm{L}}_x f(x)=g(x)$ assumes a linear differential operator $\mathop{\mathrm{L}}$, an unknown function $f$, and a right-hand side $g$ that forms the inhomogeneous part of the ODE. The \newconcept{Green's function} $G$ for the ODE (or $\mathop{\mathrm{L}}$) manifests as any solution to $\mathop{\mathrm{L}}_x G(x, y) = \Diracdelta(x-y)$. Now
    \begin{equation}
        f(x) = \integ{y} G(x, y) g(y)
    \end{equation}    
    solves the original ODE. 

    \paragraph{Homogeneous initial conditions.} %
    If $f(x_0)=\dv*{f}{x}\rvert_{x=x_0}=0$, the solution reads
    \begin{equation}
        f(x) = \integ{y}[x_0][x] G(x,y)g(y).
    \end{equation}

    %     f(x) = (G \ast g )(x) =\integ{y}G(x-y)g(y)

\subsection{Cosmic scales}
    % \begin{bullets}
    %     \item expansion rate, cosmic time, conformal time
    %     \item why is flat assumption OK?
    %     \item redshift $\redshift=a_0/a-1$
    % \end{bullets}
    % The universe expands with the rate $a(t\phys)$ at physical or rather \emph{cosmic} time $t\phys$. \comment{Explain cosmic time and $t\phys=0$.} This work sincerely favours the use of \emph{conformal} time, also known as the comoving horizon. As $t$ is a neat variable name, we shall \emph{not}  reserve it for the cosmic time, as is the most common use, but rather let it refer to the conformal time coordinate. 

    % The standard model of cosmology, the \hypertarget{abbrv:lcdm}{\textLambda{}CDM}

    % In standard model 

    % There are several common choices of time reference frames in cosmological context.
    % The standard model of cosmology offers several measurements of time that are convenient for various purposes. 
    \subsubsection{Chronology}
    The standard model of cosmology provides multiple time measurements that are useful for different applications. 
    Cosmic time $t$ is often impractical to use in physical cosmology. The Doppler shift arising from the recession of distant objects is the \newconcept{cosmic redshift} $\redshift$,%
    \footnote{
        We will use $\redshift$ to distinguish the cosmic redshift from the Cartesian spatial coordinate $z$ in $\vec{x}=(x,y,z)$, as they will both be used frequently.
    } %
    defined through
    \begin{equation}
        1 + \redshift = a(t_0)/a(t),
    \end{equation}
    where $t$ is cosmic time with value $t_0\approx 13.8$ gigayear today, and $a$ is the dimensionless \newconcept{cosmic scale factor}.\comment{Fix} The cosmic-time term is defined via $a(t\equiv 0)= 0$, which is to say that we define the time of Big Bang as this point in time. 
    In this thesis we make use of \newconcept{conformal time} $\tau$ for which ${\diff t} = a {\diff \tau}$ holds %
    %  giving
    % {\newcommand{\dummy}{}
    % \begin{equation}
    %     \tau = \integ{\dummy{t}}\frac{1}{a(\dummy{t})} =  \integ{\dummy{a}} \frac{1}{\dummy{a}^2 H(\dummy{a})}
    % \end{equation}
    % }%
    in units with $c=1$. We will use $\dot{}\equiv\dv*{}{\tau}$ as a shorthand notation for derivatives with respect to conformal time. %Another important
    Other common measures of time include the physical Hubble factor $H=1/a \dv*{a}{t}$, and conformal Hubble factor $\mathcal{H}= aH = \dot{a}/a$.

    \subsubsection{Comoving and physical scales}
    We use comoving measures of disctances and relate these to comoving wavenumbers $k$, related to comoving wavelength $\lambda$. We adapt the convention in~\citet{maggioreGravitationalWavesVol2018} and use \newconcept{reduced wavelengths}
    \begin{align}
        \lambdabar \equiv   1/k  = \lambda/(2\ppi).
    \end{align}
    % We refer to sub- and super-horizon modes as the modes for which $k\tau \ll 1 $
    Comoving scales remain constant in time. We refer to modes with wavelengths larger than the horizon, $\lambdabar\gg \mathcal{H}^{-1}(a)$, as \newconcept{super-horizon} modes, where $\mathcal{H}=1/a \dv*{a}{\tau}$ is the conformal Hubble factor (\cref{eq:GR:lcdm:first_Friedmann_conformal}) or the ``comoving horizon.'' %
    Modes well inside the horizon, $\lambdabar\ll \mathcal{H}^{-1}(a)$ are \newconcept{sub-horizon}. %
    Now, we obtain physical measurements via $k\ped{ph}(a) = k /a$ and $\lambdabar\ped{ph}(a) = a \lambdabar$.

    




\subsection{Cosmological simulations}
    % \phpar[Nyquist frequency, fundamental frequency, DFTs]

    Simulations of cosmological scenarios are usually performed on three-dimensional lattices with periodic boundaries. Say we have such a cubic lattice of side lengths $L$, with $N$ points in each direction, giving a spatial resolution of $\Delta=L/N$. %
    The \newconcept{fundamental frequency} is the smallest frequency mode, which in terms of wavenumber is $k\ped{IR}=2\ppi/L$. %\footnote{We use $\text{wavenumber} = \text{wavelength}^{-1} =  2 \ppi \times \text{frequency}$} 
    The \newconcept{Nyquist frequency}, given by the angular frequency $k\ped{UV}=k\ped{IR} N/2 = \ppi N/L$, is the highest resolvable frequency.

    % The choice of $L$ and $N$ involves a trade-off between the desire to capture large-scale structures happening on cosmological scales ($\gtrsim \mathrm{Mpc}/h$) and the need for
