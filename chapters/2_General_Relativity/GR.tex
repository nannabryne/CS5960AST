% ////////////////// intro //////////////////




Alongside quantum mechanics, Einstein's theory of gravity---general relativity---is widely accepted as the most accurate description of our surroundings. GR can be formulated from a geometrical point of view, or it can be viewed as a classical field theory. In the former approach we meet geometrical tools such as the geodesic equation, whereas the latter allows the application of field-theoretical methods. 
%This chapter lays emphasis on the field interpretation of GR. 
Considering both perspectives can be insightful and provide a better overall understand of concepts in GR.


% \phpar[Two perspectives insightful; better overall understanding of aspects of concepts in GR]

This~\lcnamecref{chap:GR} will cover the parts of GR that are most relevant for this project. In~\cref{sec:GR:diffgeo} we will introduce relevant terminology from differential geometry and elaborate on some techniques for handling hypersurfaces and conformal spaces. We move on to discuss in broad terms the Einstein's equation in~\cref{sec:GR:einstein}. A brief introduction to modern cosmology is found in~\cref{sec:GR:lcdm}, before we address gravitational waves in~\cref{sec:GR:gws}. Hopefully, this will sufficient to obtain a basic understanding of standard GR.
