To develop a classical field theory, we require a handful of mathematical \grammar[concepts]{structures} from differential geometry.

A classical field theory consists of the following mathematical structures:
\begin{description}
    \item[Spacetime] \dots
\end{description}

A spacetime is a \emph{smooth manifold} with or without additional mathematical structures.



The aim of this somewhat technical chapter is to provide the necessary mathematical tools to get a sufficient grasp of general relativity as a classical field theory.
