The manifolds of primary interest to us as gravity physicists are the \textit{pseudo-Riemannian manifolds}. Such are the very foundation of Einstein's general theory of relativity, and amongst them are Lorentzian and Riemannian manifolds.

% amongst ubclasses of this group includes Lorentzian and Riemannian manifolds. 

We let the spacetime $(\Manifold, g\_{\mu\nu})$ be made up of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $\Manifold$ and a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor $\Metric$. Then, by definition, $\Manifold$ is differentiable and $\Metric$ is smooth, non-degenerate \comment{(?)} and symmetric.
