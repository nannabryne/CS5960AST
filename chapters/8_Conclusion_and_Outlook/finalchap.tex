The Nambu--Goto formulation with time-varying surface tension gives rise to an analytically solvable equation of motion for the planar-wall perturbation in the flat FLRW universe dominated by non-relativistic matter. Simulations show relatively good correspondence with the full theory. There exists loose restrictions for the maximum amplitude of the perturbation and of the scalar field fluctuations. 

Validations of the gravitational-wave calculations are inconclusive. Our simulation results show patterns in the gravitational signature that are directly connected to the nature of the wall displacement field, but the exact relations are unclear. 

There is a substantial amount of work left if we ever want to compare this to actual gravitational-wave observations.


The results overall are intriguing, and show promise of future analytical estimations of gravitational waves from topological defects. The time-varying surface tension is effectively an additional damping in the equation of motion for the wall displacement field, and during a symmetron phase-transition, there exists explicit solutions to this equation.
