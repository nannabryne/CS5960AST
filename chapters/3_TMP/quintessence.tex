The general picture interprets quintessence as a group of scalar--tensor theories; a subgroup of modifications to gravity in which a scalar field is added to the total action. By going through all possible covariants with maximum second order time derivatives in four dimensional spacetime, one arrives at the most general formulation of these type of theories, the \emph{Hordenski theory}. Said theory is summed up by the total Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}\nped{H} = \mathcal{L}\ped{m} + M\nped{Pl}^2 \sum_{i=2}^{5} \mathcal{L}_i$, where $\mathcal{L}_i$ are built up by derivatives of the scalar field, the Einstein tensor and arbitrary functionals of the scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X = - \frac{1}{2} \phi\^{;\mu}\phi\_{;\mu}$.%
\footnote{%
With the usual notation convention and arbitrary functionals $G_i$, the Lagrangian densities $\mathcal{L}_i$ are given by the following:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \mathcal{L}_2 &= G_2(\phi, X), \\
        \mathcal{L}_3 &= G_3 (\phi, X)\sq \phi, \\
        \mathcal{L}_4 &= G_4 (\phi, X)\mathcal{R} + G_{4,X}(\phi, X) \pclosed{ {(\sq \phi)}^2 - \phi\_{;\mu\nu} \phi\^{;\mu\nu}}, \\
        \mathcal{L}_5 &= G_5 \mathcal{G}\_{\mu\nu}\phi\^{;\mu\nu} - \sfrac{1}{6} G_{5,X}(\phi, X)  \pclosed{ {(\sq \phi)}^3 + 
        2\phi\indices{^\nu_{;\mu}}\phi\indices{^\mu_{;\nu}} - 3  \phi\_{;\mu\nu} \phi\^{;\mu\nu} \sq \phi},
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}%
where $G_{i,X}= \pdv*{G_i}{X}$.
}~%
Let $\mathcal{L}_i=0$ as a starting point. %
General relativity---represented by the Einstein--Hilbert action---is retrieved with $\mathcal{L}_4 = \mathcal{R}/2$.  By also setting $\mathcal{L}_2 = X(\phi)-V(\phi)$, we get a quintessence model. Performing relevant variations eventually gives an equation of motion that is indistinguishable from standard GR with $\mathcal{L}\ped{m} \to \mathcal{L}\ped{m} + \mathcal{L}_2$ in the stress--energy tensor on the right-hand side of the Einstein equation. Thus, quintessence models are not actually modified gravity theories, but adds to the total matter in the universe, and should be classified as a scalar field theory rather than a scalar--tensor theory. %

\subsection{General framework}\label{sec:cosmo:quintessence:framework}
    We go through the dynamics of a bosonic quintessence field $\phi$ that is associated with a kinetic term $X=- \frac{1}{2} g\^{\mu\nu} \phi\_{;\mu}\phi\_{,\nu}$ and potential energy $V(\phi)$ in \cringe{rough stages}. This will lay the foundation for our treatment of the (a)symmetron model in~\cref{sec:cosmo:quintessence:asymmetron}.

    % In the Jordan frame, matter fields---denoted collectively by $\Psi$---couple minimally to gravity. In the Einstein frame where the Einstein--Hilbert action assumes its usual form, matter may couple non-minimally to the scalar $\phi$
    The dynamics of the quintessence field $\phi$ is described by the Einstein-frame action (see~\cref{sec:GR:diffgeo:conformal})
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:cosmo:quintessence:quintessence_action_Einstein}
        S =\integ[4]{x\sqrt{-g}} \cclosed{ \frac{M\nped{Pl}^2}{2} \mathcal{R} + X(\phi) - V(\phi)} + S\ped{m}[\widetilde{g}\_{\mu\nu} , \Psi],
    \end{equation} 
    where $\Psi$ collects all matter fields, which couple minimally to the Jordan-frame metric,
    \begin{equation}
        \widetilde{g}\_{\mu\nu} = A^2 (\phi) g\_{\mu\nu},
    \end{equation}
    and $S\ped{m}$ is the total matter action. 
    Without the presence of this last term, the equation of motion for the scalar field is $\sq \phi = V_{,\phi}$. %
    % \nc{Some article}[appendix?] shows that 
    The minimal coupling to matter contributes s.t.~$\sq\phi \supset - A^{-1} A_{,\phi}T\ped{m} $, which amounts to writing
    \begin{equation}
        \sq \phi = {V\ped{eff}}_{,\phi}; \quad V\ped{eff}(\phi) \equiv V(\phi) - \ln{A(\phi)} \cdot T\ped{m}.
    \end{equation}
    % Here, $T\ped{m}= g\^{\mu\nu}T\indices*{^{\mathrm{(m)}}_{\mu\nu}}$ 
    Here, $T\ped{m}=A^4 \widetilde{T}\ped{m}$, $ \widetilde{T}\ped{m}=  {}\ap{(m)}\widetilde{T}\_{\mu\nu}\widetilde{g}\^{\mu\nu} $, is the trace of the Einstein-frame matter SE tensor. For a perfect fluid, $T\ped{m}\rvert\ped{p.f.}=-\rho + 3p$, and in the non-relativistic limit, we have $p\to 0$. %\speak{Maybe write ${}\ap{(m)}T\_{\mu\nu}$ etc.}

    \subsubsection{Review}

    Matter particles in the Jordan frame obey the simple geodesic equation as there is no coupling to $\phi$. On the other hand, particles in the Einstein frame matter sector experience a \newconcept{fifth force} due to the universal coupling. The fifth force concept captures the non-trivial right-hand side of in the geodesic equation,\checkthis{
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:cosmo:quintessence:framework:fifth_force}
        % \dv[2]{\vec{x}}{t} 
        \vec{x}\_{,tt} \supset \frac{\vec{F}_5}{m} = - \frac{\beta}{M\nped{Pl}} \vec{\nabla}\phi.
    \end{equation}}
    $\beta$ is then a measure of the strength of the fifth force relative to the Newtonian gravitational force.  
    % \comment{Violation of WEP. Maybe refer to equations in~\cref{sec:GR:einstein}?}

    % Matter particles in the Jordan frame move freely, i.e. obey the geodesic equation, whereas articles in the Einstein frame matter sector do not.

    The dynamic equation-of-state parameter is 
    \begin{equation}
        w_\phi =  \frac{\rho_\phi}{p_\phi}= \frac{\frac{1}{2a^2} \dot{\phi}^2 - V(\phi) }{\frac{1}{2a^2} \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi)},
    \end{equation}
    for which $\lim_{\dot{\phi}\to 0}{w_\phi}=w_\Lambda = -1$. %
    These models are thus often proposed in context of dark-energy models to explain the accelerated cosmic expansion. We will not consider this directly in this project.





    \subsection{Asymmetron model}\label{sec:cosmo:quintessence:asymmetron}
    The particular quintessence model characterised by the symmetric Mexican-hat potential
    \begin{equation}
        V(\phi) = \frac{\lambda}{4} \phi^4  - \frac{\mu^2}{2} \phi^2 + V_0
    \end{equation}
    is called the \newconcept{symmetron} model~\citep{hinterbichlerSymmetronCosmology2011}. This theory is invariant under reflection, $\phi\to -\phi$, ($\phi$ is $\Zn$ symmetric) a \nc{requirement from quantum theory.}[lost reference:(] (\iftime{Comment on this.}) %
    Not equally well-established is the generalisation of this model called the \newconcept{\emph{a}symmetron}~\citep{perivolaropoulosGravitationalTransitionsExplicitly2022}, in which the potential is given an additional cubic term, $V(\phi)\supset -\kappa\phi^3/3 $. Here, one of the domains is favoured over the other. 

    Now, why would we want this asymmetry in the first place? It complicates things by breaking the $\Zn$ symmetry of the symmetron, so the theory only holds approximately. However, this asymmetry can aid in overcoming the domain wall problem, manifest in the inevitable biased domain wall collapse. We mentioned this briefly in~\cref{sec:cosmo:defects:dws}. %
    We stress that introducing asymmetry in this way is different from energy bias in the sense that not only is the energy in the two domains different, but the expectation values for $\phi$ are shifted.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        {\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{dummy_normal1.8.png}}
        {\caption{\comment{(A)SYMMETRON DEMO}}}
        \label{fig:cosmo:quintessence:dummy}
    \end{figure}

    The simplest symmetron model has the quadratic coupling
    \begin{equation}
        A(\phi)  = 1 +\frac{1}{2} \pclosed{\frac{\phi}{M}}^2 + \mathscr{O}\Big( {(\phi/M)}^4 \Big).
    \end{equation}
    The effective potential is then given by~\citep{hinterbichlerSymmetronCosmology2011}
    \boxedeq{eq:cosmo:quintessence:asymmetron_effective_potential}{
    V\ped{eff}(\phi) = \frac{\lambda}{4} \phi^4 - \frac{\kappa}{3}\phi^3 + \frac{\mu^2}{2}\pclosed{\frac{\rho}{\mu^2M^2}-1} \phi^2 + V_0.}
    %
    This potential becomes unstable when $\rho\leq \mu^2M^2\equiv \rho_\ast$, and the field rolls into either of the two vacua. From the cosmological perspective, ignoring $\kappa$, we imagine an initially dense region in the universe where a scalar field oscillates slightly around zero. The energy density dilutes and eventually reaches $\rho=\rho_\ast$, spontaneously breaking the $\Zn$ symmetry, and separates the scalar field into domains according to their sign at the time. The potential barriers created at this \emph{phase transition} correspond to the topological solitons discussed in~\cref{sec:cosmo:defects:dws}; namely cosmic domain walls.
    %  The potential barriers created at this \emph{phase transition} \checkthis{represent topological defects}, e.g.~domain walls.

    % \end{figure}



    Let $\upsilon\equiv\rho\ped{m}/(\mu^2M^2)$. By setting $V\ped{eff,\phi}=0$, we find the vacuum expectation values (VEVs)
    \begin{equation}
        \phi_0 = 0 \quad \lor \quad \phi_\pm = \phi_\infty \pclosed{\bar{\kappa} \pm  \sqrt{\bar{\kappa}^2 +  1- \upsilon }},%\frac{\kappa \pm \sqrt{\kappa^2 + 4\lambda\mu^2 \pclosed{1- \rho\ped{m}/(\mu^2M^2)} } }{2\lambda}
    \end{equation}
    where we defined $\bar{\kappa} = \kappa / (2\mu \sqrt{\lambda}) $ and $\phi_\infty = \mu/\sqrt{\lambda}$. Note that for the symmetron ($\kappa=0$), since the field is real, VEV is zero before SSB. We determine the stability of these vacua by evaluating $V\ped{eff,\phi\phi}$ at $\phi=\phi_0,\phi_\pm$ and see that $\phi_0$ remains stable until $\rho=\rho_\ast$.\footnote{This is not entirely true for the asymmetron, but we will not discuss this here.}


    \subsubsection{Screening}
    In this context, a \newconcept{screening mechanism} is a property of the model that removes the effect of the extra scalar field in the appropriate environment. The symmetron scalar field mediates fifth forces in low-density environments while being screened in dense regions. We illustrate this in~\cref{fig:cosmo:quintessence:asymmetron_demo}.

    % \phpar[parameter space of asymmetron]

    The quartic coupling constant $\lambda$ measures the scalar self-interactions and $\mu$ defines the bare mass of the (a)symmetron. The cubic coupling $\kappa$ is a measure of the difference between the two vacua, and is zero in the symmetron case. The constant $V_0$ can be interpreted as a cosmological constant \textLambda~\citep{christiansenAsevolutionRelativisticNbody2023}, but we will not discuss this here. The conformal coupling scale $M$ governs the matter coupling strength~\citep{burrageAccurateComputationScreening2024}. We introduce the \newconcept{symmetron Compton wavelength}
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:cosmo:quintessence:symmetron_Compton_wavelength}
        L\nped{C} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\mu}
    \end{equation}
    which defines the range of the symmetron forces. %
    Local tests of gravity require $M \lesssim 10^{-3} M\nped{Pl}$ for the quadratic coupling~\citep{burrageAccurateComputationScreening2024,hinterbichlerSymmetronCosmology2011,hinterbichlerScreeningLongRangeForces2010}. This is to say that fifth forces is mediated within a range $L\nped{C}\lesssim\mathrm{Mpc}$~\citep{hinterbichlerScreeningLongRangeForces2010}.
