% ////////////////// intro //////////////////


Alongside quantum mechanics, Einstein's theory of gravity---general relativity (GR)---is widely accepted as the most accurate description of our surroundings. GR can be formulated from a geometrical point of view, or it can be viewed as a classical field theory. In the former approach we meet geometrical tools such as the geodesic equation, whereas the latter allows the application of field-theoretical methods. This chapter lays emphasis on the field interpretation of GR.
