    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analytical solution $\epsA[\epsilon]$ is---to the best of our knowledge---new. \note{MD, symmetron \par One step closer to analytical estimations of GW spectra}
        \item Formula for gravitational waves needs further validation. 
        \item Solid foundation is laid for further similar analyses with \asgrd. 
    \end{itemize}
